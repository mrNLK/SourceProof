# SourceKit Talent Finder

AI-powered GitHub talent sourcing for technical recruiting. Find engineers by what they've actually built — their open-source contributions, repositories, and shipped code — not just their LinkedIn headlines.

## What It Does

SourceKit turns GitHub's open-source graph into a recruiting pipeline:

- **Research** — Paste a job description or describe a role, and AI builds a sourcing strategy: target repos to mine, companies to source from, skills to weight, and EEA (Evidence of Exceptional Ability) signals to detect.
- **Search** — Finds real GitHub contributors matching your criteria, scores them 0–100, and surfaces hidden gems (high-quality, low-visibility engineers).
- **Enrich** — Looks up LinkedIn profiles via Exa semantic search and finds contact information.
- **Pipeline** — Kanban board to track candidates through Contacted → Not Interested → Recruiter Screen → Rejected → Moved to ATS.
- **Outreach** — AI writes personalized messages referencing the candidate's actual open-source work.
- **Bulk Actions** — Compare, rank, and draft outreach for multiple candidates with an AI chat interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Auth)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude (query parsing, candidate scoring, research, outreach generation)
- **Search:** GitHub REST API (contributor mining, profile enrichment), Exa (LinkedIn lookup)
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Vercel Web Analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- A Supabase project
- API keys for: GitHub, Anthropic, and Exa

### Setup

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mrNLK/SourceProof.git
cd SourceProof

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual keys (see below)

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase anon/public key |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Supabase project ID |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (Edge Functions only) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | Exa API key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook secret |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | Stripe price ID |

> **Important:** The `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must also be set as environment variables in your Vercel project settings for the production deployment to work.

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Connect this repo to a Vercel project.
2. Add all `VITE_*` environment variables in **Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables**.
3. Deploy. The `vercel.json` config handles SPA routing automatically.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server (localhost:5173) |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run tests (Vitest) |
